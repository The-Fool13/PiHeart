# Pi Heart

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a non-invasive heart rate monitor wheel cover. It allows for a users heart rate to be tracked while driving and once an irrigular heart rate is detected it will call emericance servies or their emercancy contact. 

## Key Features

- Comprehensive sensor suite for real-time monitoring
- Circuit wiring and durablity 
- Community web application for monitoring
  - Python Flask + MongoDB backend
- **Budget:** $500
- **Duration:** 9 months

## Goals
Develop an open-source hydroponic system to enable community-driven, urban agriculture, addressing the challenge of food deserts and their impact on academic performance. The project focuses on simplifying the hydroponics process for beginners, providing a robust system for easy monitoring and maintenance, and fostering community engagement to sustain interest and success in hydroponic gardening.

## Milestones
- Research, design, and component sourcing
- System assembly and testing
- Creation of a functioning prototype using heart sensors and raspberry pi 
- Demonstration of prototype efficacy with basic finger placement

## Problem Addressed
Tackles the challenges of people causing accidents due to poor heart health or unexpected causes.
